contigAlignmentAnalyzer.cpp

This software is useful in finding out  genomic structural variation. After the short reads (from an NGS experiment) are denovo assembled contigs are obtained. Such a contigs can be aligned by the use of tools such as Blast or Lastz. The alignment file is used as input infile in this script.

Sintax:

./contigAlignmentAnalyzer inputFile minimumBitCutoff freeSlot minimumInsertionSize minimumDeletionSize minimumTranslocationSize minimumInversionSize minimumTranslocationPlusInversionSize minimumDuplicaitonSize searchGoldenPolymorphysm pileupFolderName generateInsertionGE generateDeletionsGE generateTranslocationGE generateInversionGE generateTranslocPlusInversion generateDuplicationGE alignmentFormat

Explanation of arguments:
inputFile : the file name with path containing the contig alignment 
minimumBitCutoff: minimum contig substring that must be aligned in order to be considered
freeSlot: additional argument with no meanings (the GUI pass the string "none". It can be used for possible additional arguments in the future)
minimumXXXXXXsize: all these arguments tell the software what is the minimum size for the identified structural variation in order to report it in output
searchGoldenPolymorphysm: if this is set to 1 then a golden polymorphysm set is generated. When the contig are aligned on a reference genome snp and small indel are identified. On the other hand direct alignments of the short reads on the reference genome generates snp and indel as well and it is reported in a pileup folder generated by another Altools script named pileupAnalyzer. This function merge snp and indel found with the two methodology and report the ones that resulted from both approaches.
pileupFolderName: path for the folder name (to be used if the previous tag is set to 1)
generateXXXXXXGE: all these tags when set to 1 will generate a "genic extractor" file. The genic extractor file can be used with the Altools scrip "genicExtractor" in otder to check whether the found structural variation contains any functional gene.

alignmentFormat: this tells the script in which format the input file is written. It can accept lastz, blast(tabular - format = 6) and bast (default) format.
