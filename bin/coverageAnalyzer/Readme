coverageAnalyzer.cpp

this software can be used in order to analyze the coverage distribution along the chromosomes after the short reads alignments on the reference genome. It will output the area of zero coverage (regions in the reference genome that are not present in the studied genome) and the possible copy nymber variations. This script is  implemented  in order to embed the dnaCopy alogrythm to find the copy number variation. 

Syntax

./coverageAnalyzer inputDirectory minimumReadsNumberLowCoverage 	minimumReadsNumberHighCoverage 	minimumAreaToOutput verboseOutput generateGEFiles outputFolder referencePileupFolder 

inputDirectory: this is the path of the pileup folder that is generated by the Altools script pileupAnalyzer.

minimumReadsNumberLowCoverage: this is the cutoff for the number of reads needed in order to call a position as covered. Any coverage lower than this is considered zero

minimumReadsNumberHighCoverage: this (in the GUI called percentage logRatio distribution) is the percentage to be used to call genomic areas losses and gains. In practice for each chromosome the coverage log ratio of a subject genome and a reference genome is computer and the values (averaged for each window) are sorted. The value at the first  minimumReadsNumberHighCoverage percent will be the cut-off for calling losses from the dnaCopy elaboration, the last minimumReadsNumberHighCoverage percent will be used for gains. 


minimumAreaToOutput: this is the minimum length of the found zero coverage or high coverage areas that will be send to output.

verboseOutput: if 1 it generates a verbose output

generateGEFiles: if 1 it will generates for the zero coverage and hogh coverage areas two "genic extractor" files that can be used by the Altools script genicExtractor in order to investigate whether these areas contain functional genes.

outputFolder: it defines the output folder

referencePileupFolder: in the approach with the dnacopy algorythm (to be implemented) also the reference genome will need to be treated with the Altools script pileupAnalyzer. The path of the resulting pileup folder is inserted here.

windowSize: is the size of the windows that is considered during elaboration. A value of 1 will output the copy number variations and the zero coverage areas with a single base precision
