variantAnalyzer.cpp

This tool take in input the pileup file generated by varscan , the annotation file of the studied organism in gff3 format, and the sequences files. It will generate a table where each polymorphysm is annotated in terms of presence in 3UTR, 5UTR and CDS sequence, possible frameshift (in the case of indel) position within the sequence and possible change of amminoacid

Syntax:

./variantAnalyzer inputFileName annotationFile sequencesFolder verboseOutput minimumCoverage snpPValue indelPValue

Arguments:

inputFileName: the  varscan pileup file

annotationfile: the annotation gff3 formatted file

sequencesFolder: the folder containing 3 multifasta file containing the utr and coding sequences called 3UTR, 5UTR and CDS respectively

verboseOutput: when it is 1 a verbouse output will be generated

minimumCoverage: minimum coverage for a polymorphism to be considerated

snpPValue: pValue for a snp in order to be considered in the analysis

indelPValue: pvalue for an indel in order to be considered in the analysis
